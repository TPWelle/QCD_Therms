This repository contains the code used to compute the QCD equations of state described here:

https://drive.google.com/file/d/1dujfQ2quk7MV_XeySzCJEIGA3D6aMPYt/view?usp=drive_link

These use python 3.8 and C++11. The following libraries are needed to use this software:

GSL: https://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/
OpenMP: https://www.openmp.org
pybind11: https://github.com/pybind/pybind11

Refer to "compute.py" for information on how to run each model.

To run it, enter:
"make compute"
